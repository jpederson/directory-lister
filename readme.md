## Directory Lister

A simple directory listing script written in PHP. Just drop the index.php file into the directory you'd like to list on a server that runs PHP. It only lists the current directory, and links directly to resources so it can't be abused to list anything else. The icons are base64-encoded into the stylesheet that's included in the file, so the script doesn't need a resource folder. 

75 clean lines of awesome. Enjoy!
